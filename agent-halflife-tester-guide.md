## Understanding the Dashboard

The dashboard presents four key elements after a benchmark run:

### Half-Life Value

Displayed prominently at the top of the dashboard:

```
Half-Life: 13.5 tasks
```

This is the number of sequential tasks at which the agent's cumulative success probability drops to 50%. Higher is better.

### Verdict

A qualitative assessment based on the half-life value:

| Half-Life       | Verdict       | Color  | Meaning                                      |
|-----------------|---------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| ≥ 50 tasks      | **Excellent** | 🟢 Green  | Highly reliable for extended autonomous runs |
| 20–49 tasks     | **Good**      | 🟢 Green  | Suitable for moderate task chains            |
| 10–19 tasks     | **Marginal**  | 🟡 Yellow | Use with human checkpoints                   |
| 5–9 tasks       | **Poor**      | 🟠 Orange | Requires frequent human oversight            |
| < 5 tasks       | **Unreliable**| 🔴 Red    | Not suitable for autonomous operation        |

### Survival Curve

An exponential decay plot showing:

- **X-axis**: Number of sequential tasks (n)
- **Y-axis**: Cumulative success probability P(n) = p^n
- **Red dashed line**: The 50% threshold
- **Vertical marker**: The half-life point where the curve crosses 50%

The curve visually demonstrates how quickly reliability degrades with sequential task chaining.

### Tier Breakdown Chart

A bar chart showing per-tier pass rates:

- **Easy**: Expected 95–100% for capable agents
- **Medium**: Expected 80–95%
- **Hard**: Expected 60–85%
- **Expert**: Expected 40–70%

Bars are color-coded: green (above expected), yellow (within range), red (below expected).

## Toby Ord's Scaling Rules Explained

Toby Ord's 2025 analysis provides a framework for understanding AI agent reliability at scale:

### The Core Insight

Even a small per-task error rate compounds dramatically over sequential tasks. An agent that succeeds 95% of the time on individual tasks will fail at least once within just 14 tasks with 50% probability.

### The Mathematics

Given:
- **p** = per-task success probability (e.g., 0.95)
- **n** = number of sequential tasks
- **P(n)** = probability of completing all n tasks = p^n

The half-life is:

```
n½ = log(0.5) / log(p) = -0.693 / log(p)
```

### Scaling Table

| Per-Task Rate | Half-Life | Implication                          |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| 99%           | 69 tasks  | Reliable for long autonomous runs    |
| 97%           | 23 tasks  | Good for medium workflows            |
| 95%           | 14 tasks  | Marginal — checkpoint every ~10 tasks|
| 90%           | 7 tasks   | Poor — needs constant oversight      |
| 85%           | 4 tasks   | Unreliable for chaining              |
| 80%           | 3 tasks   | Effectively single-task only         |

### Why This Matters

Many AI agent benchmarks report individual task accuracy (e.g., "95% on SWE-Bench"). Ord's model shows that this headline number is misleading for real-world use, where agents must complete **chains** of tasks. The half-life metric provides a more honest assessment of practical reliability.

## FAQ

### Q: What is a "half-life" in this context?

**A:** The half-life is the number of sequential tasks an AI agent can attempt before the cumulative probability of all tasks being correct drops to 50%. It's derived from the per-task success rate using the formula `n½ = log(0.5) / log(p)`, based on Toby Ord's exponential decay model.

### Q: How many tasks does the benchmark suite include?

**A:** The full suite includes 60 tasks across 4 tiers: 20 Easy, 20 Medium, 12 Hard, and 8 Expert. Running the full suite typically takes 30–90 minutes depending on the agent and connection speed.

### Q: Can I add my own benchmark tasks?

**A:** Yes. Go to **Settings → Benchmark → Custom Tasks** and add tasks with a prompt, expected output criteria, and difficulty tier. Custom tasks are included in the half-life calculation alongside built-in tasks.

### Q: Is the testing deterministic?

**A:** Agent responses are inherently non-deterministic. We recommend running the benchmark at least 3 times and using the average half-life for a reliable estimate. The **History → Compare Runs** feature helps track variance across runs.

### Q: Does it work offline?

**A:** CLI-based providers (Claude Code CLI, custom CLI agents) work offline as long as the agent itself runs locally. API-based providers require an internet connection.

### Q: Can I test agents other than Claude and GPT?

**A:** Yes. Use the **Custom Agent** provider to connect any agent accessible via CLI command or REST API. See [Setting Up Providers → Custom Agent](#custom-agent).

### Q: How is the verdict determined?

**A:** The verdict is based on the calculated half-life value: Excellent (≥50), Good (20–49), Marginal (10–19), Poor (5–9), Unreliable (<5). These thresholds are calibrated to practical autonomous workflow requirements.

### Q: What data is collected?

**A:** All benchmark data is stored locally on your machine at `%APPDATA%\AgentHalfLifeTester\`. No data is sent to ESW Lab servers. The only network call is license key validation during activation.

### Q: Can I use this for CI/CD pipelines?

**A:** Not yet, but a CLI-only mode for headless execution is on the roadmap. Contact [support@eswlab.com](mailto:support@eswlab.com) if this is a priority for your team.

### Q: Where can I learn more about Toby Ord's research?

**A:** Toby Ord's 2025 research on AI agent reliability and exponential decay models is the theoretical foundation. The key insight is that per-task accuracy is insufficient for evaluating agents in sequential workflows — the half-life metric provides a more practical measure. See the [Scaling Rules](#toby-ords-scaling-rules-explained) section for details.
